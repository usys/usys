WHAT IT IS:          T386.EXE is a program for Toshiba laptop computers which
                     allows the PopUp menu to appear when QEMM is installed
                     and enabled.  T386 works with all versions of QEMM and
                     many Toshiba laptops.


WHY IT IS NEEDED:    Toshiba's PopUp menu will not appear if the computer is
                     in Virtual 8086 mode unless the expanded memory manager
                     calls itself "T386". The computer is always in Virtual
                     8086 mode when expanded memory is in use or high RAM has
                     been created.  Therefore, when QEMM is performing these
                     services you will not be able to access the PopUp menu.
                     The T386 program makes QEMM appear to be named T386 and
                     allows the menu to work properly.


HOW TO USE IT:       To invoke the program, simply type:

                             T386

                     at the DOS command prompt.  You may also load T386 in
                     your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  The program can be loaded into
                     upper memory by typing:

                             LOADHI T386

                     at the DOS command prompt.  If T386 is loaded in your
                     AUTOEXEC.BAT file, it can be loaded high with Optimize.


HOW TO UNLOAD:       You can remove T386 from memory (even if it is loaded
                     into upper memory) by typing:

                             T386 R

                     at the DOS command prompt.  You can load T386 more than
                     once with no adverse effects other than wasting a bit of
                     memory.  Typing "T386 R" removes one instance of T386.
                     If you have inadvertently loaded it more than once, type
                     the command once to remove each instance.  Typing the
                     command when T386 is NOT loaded in memory is not harmful.
