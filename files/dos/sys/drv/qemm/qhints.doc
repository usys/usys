                     ÿþçQEMM and Microsoft Windows

  QEMM is fully compatible with Microsoft Windows 3.0 and 3.1. 
  QEMM automatically provides 8K-24K more memory for running 
  DOS programs inside Windows 386 enhanced mode.

  Also, you can use QEMM's VIDRAM feature to extend the amount of
  memory available to DOS text-based programs running in Windows by 
  up to 96K.  (For information, see Chapter 6 in the QEMM manual.)

  If you install Windows after installing QEMM, be sure to run 
  QSETUP and select "Specify Microsoft Windows directory."  This
  selection will add the line SystemROMBreakPoint=false to your 
  SYSTEM.INI file, a Windows configuration file, to ensure that 
  Windows runs optimally with QEMM.
               ÿþçQEMM and Microsoft Windows (Continued)

  In the unlikely event that you experience problems with Windows 
  after installing QEMM, see the text file WINFLOW.TEC in the 
  \QEMM\TECHNOTE directory.  You can view technotes with QEMM 
  Setup by selecting "View QEMM hints technotes and READ.ME" at
  main menu.
                  ÿþçQEMM and DESQview or DESQview/X

  If you are using DESQview or DESQview/X, you can increase the 
  amount of memory in each window by using the Stealth ROM 
  feature. To find out if you are using Stealth ROM, select 
  "Review or change QEMM parameters" from the main QEMM Setup menu. 
  Then look for the selection "Stealth system and video ROMs." If 
  you see the word "Mapping" or "Frame" at the end of that line, 
  Stealth ROM is already enabled. If you see the word "Off," you
  can enable Stealth ROM by typing "S" or hitting the ENTER key,
  then following the on-screen instructions.  Online Help will tell
  you more about the Mapping and Frame methods of Stealth ROM.
    
  If you have DOS version 5 or 6, QEMM's installation places the 
  command DOS=HIGH in your CONFIG.SYS file (if it is not already 
             ÿþçQEMM and DESQview or DESQview/X (Continued)

  there). This is a DOS command that loads part of DOS and DOS 
  BUFFERS into the HMA (the first 64K of memory above 1MB). 

  You may be able to increase the amount of memory in DESQview or 
  DESQview/X windows by deleting DOS=HIGH from CONFIG.SYS. To find 
  out, first run Memory Status from inside DESQview or DESQview/X.
  Make a note of the figure in the bottom right under "Largest
  Available Expanded Memory."  Then delete DOS=HIGH from your
  CONFIG.SYS and run Optimize by typing OPTIMIZE at the DOS prompt.
  
  When Optimize completes, run Memory Status from inside DESQview 
  or DESQview/X and check "Largest Available Expanded Memory" 
  again.  If it is a larger number than before, you are better off 
             ÿþçQEMM and DESQview or DESQview/X (Continued)
 
  without DOS=HIGH. Otherwise, add the line DOS=HIGH back to 
  CONFIG.SYS and re-run Optimize.
                ÿþçQEMM with DR DOS 6 or Novell DOS 7

  DOS-Up is compatible with both Novell DOS 7 and DR DOS 6, but not
  with DR DOS 5.  For complete information on using QEMM with DR DOS
  6 or Novell DOS 7, see the text file DRDOS6.TEC or NOVELL7.TEC in
  the \QEMM\TECHNOTE directory. You can view technotes with QEMM
  Setup by selecting "View QEMM hints technotes and READ.ME" at the
  main menu.

                     ÿþçQEMM and Disk Compressors
                     ÿþç(e.g., Stacker, SuperStor)

  Depending on the disk compressor you are using, you may need to 
  take special steps to use QEMM. We have provided technical 
  bulletins (technotes) covering Stacker, SuperStor, XtraDrive, and 
  DoubleDisk in the \QEMM\TECHNOTE directory.
  
  ÿþèStackerÿþæ - If you have Stacker version 2.0x, 3.0 or 3.1, no
  special steps are generally required; however, we do suggest you
  read the technote STACKER3.TEC before running Optimize.  If you
  are using Stacker 4.0, see the technote STACKER4.TEC.

            ÿþçUsing QEMM with Disk Compressors (Continued)

  ÿþèSuperStorÿþæ - Before running Optimize, read SSTOR.TEC.

  ÿþèXtraDriveÿþæ - Please see the technote XTRADRV.TEC.

  ÿþèDoubleSpaceÿþæ - If you are using MS-DOS 6's DoubleSpace,
  you can save 40K of memory by using QEMM's Stealth DoubleSpace
  feature to relocate the DoubleSpace device driver in expanded
  memory.  See Chapter 5 of the QEMM manual for details.
                   ÿþçQEMM and Bus-Mastering Devices

  Certain SCSI disk controller cards (and, less frequently, ESDI
  disk controllers and network cards) use a technique called
  bus-mastering to speed up disk access. This technique causes a
  conflict when a memory manager (such as QEMM) attempts to load a
  device driver or TSR into upper memory.  In some, but not all,
  cases QEMM can detect a bus-mastering hard disk controller and
  will take steps to prevent this from happening.  (This is not
  true if the card controls something other than a hard drive or
  if QEMM is not being loaded from the bus-mastering hard drive.)

  The typical symptom of a bus-mastering controller is a lock up
  during Optimize.
             ÿþçQEMM and Bus-Mastering Devices (Continued)
  
  Fortunately, there are solutions to this problem. For a 
  detailed explanation of bus-mastering and suggestions for 
  resolving the conflicts caused by its use, please refer to our 
  technical bulletin BUS-MAST.TEC which can be found in your 
  \QEMM\TECHNOTE directory.  You can view technotes with QEMM Setup
  by selecting "View QEMM hints technotes and READ.ME" at the main 
  menu.   
                    ÿþçQEMM and the EMS Page Frame

  Most programs that use expanded memory (EMS) access up to 64K 
  of expanded memory at a time (in 16K units called pages) at a 
  special area of upper memory called the page frame. An expanded 
  memory manager (QEMM) makes memory from outside the first 
  megabyte of memory appear in the page frame. 

  QEMM's installation normally reserves 64K of upper memory for 
  use as a page frame. You can use QSETUP to specify that no 
  page frame should be used. 
   
  The advantage of eliminating the page frame is that you will free 
  up 64K of upper memory. The disadvantages are 1) programs that 
  use EMS memory will not have it, and 2) you will not be able to
            ÿþçQEMM and the EMS Page Frame (Continued)

  use the Stealth ROM and Stealth DoubleSpace features, which can
  typically gain you 48K-115K of additional usable upper memory, 
  and 40K beyond that if you are using MS-DOS 6's DoubleSpace 
  disk compression feature.
  
  Because a great number of DOS applications can use EMS memory 
  and because you can gain even more usable upper memory with 
  Stealth, we recommend you use a page frame.
    
  To eliminate the page frame, select "Review or change QEMM 
  parameters" from the main QEMM Setup menu, then select "Set page 
  frame" and specify NONE. To help you decide if you need a page 
  frame, press PgDn see the partial list of programs that use EMS.

                     ÿþçQEMM's Stealth ROM Feature 

  Stealth ROM is an exclusive QEMM feature that can typically
  create an additional 48K to 115K of High RAM on almost any PC. 
  Stealth ROM hides your PC's ROMs and makes their memory addresses 
  available for High RAM or expanded memory mapping. The advantage 
  of having the additional High RAM is that QEMM can load TSRs, 
  device drivers and selected parts of DOS there instead of in 
  conventional memory. By freeing up conventional memory, you will 
  have more room for running DOS programs.

  Depending on your configuration and the installation options you 
  chose, Stealth ROM may have been enabled on your system when you 
  installed QEMM. When you run the Optimize program, Optimize 
               ÿþçQEMM's Stealth ROM Feature (Continued)

  will try to load your TSRs, device drivers and selected parts of 
  DOS into High RAM. If all of them will not fit, Optimize will 
  test your system for compatibility with Stealth ROM and will 
  determine which Stealth ROM method is best for your system. 

  Is there any reason not to use Stealth?  Yes, you may not need it
  if all your device drivers, TSRs and parts of DOS fit into High
  RAM without Stealth ROM enabled. The extra High RAM that Stealth 
  ROM creates actually comes from QEMM's pool of memory, so by not
  using Stealth ROM you have slightly more memory for programs that 
  use expanded or extended memory. A good rule of thumb is to let
               ÿþçQEMM's Stealth ROM Feature (Continued)

  Optimize decide whether you need Stealth ROM--if Optimize does
  not suggest Stealth testing, you do not need Stealth ROM. 

  There is one exception--we recommend you use Stealth if you use 
  DESQview or DESQview/X (see below).  Also, there are a few 
  machines that are incompatible with Stealth ROM; Optimize
  attempts to detect incompatibitiles during Stealth testing and 
  will not enable Stealth ROM on machines that it finds are 
  incompatible. 
  
  DESQview and DESQview/X can use the additional High RAM provided
  by Stealth ROM. So if you regularly use DESQview or DESQview/X, 
  we recommend you use Stealth ROM, even if Optimize did not 
               ÿþçQEMM's Stealth ROM Feature (Continued)

  recommend it. To find out if you are using Stealth ROM, type QEMM
  at the DOS prompt. QEMM will display some status information. 
  If you see information about the "Stealth type," Stealth ROM is 
  already enabled. If not, you can have Optimize perform Stealth 
  ROM testing by typing OPTIMIZE /ST. 
                      ÿþçQEMM's Optimize Program

  Optimize is a program that determines how to load TSRs, device 
  drivers and selected parts of DOS into upper memory. Optimize 
  analyzes the memory requirements of device drivers and TSRs that 
  you are loading from CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT and any batch 
  files called by AUTOEXEC.BAT. Then, Optimize determines the most 
  efficient way to load items into High RAM by testing all possible 
  locations.  There can be thousands or millions of possibilities.

  The object is to free up as much conventional memory as possible 
  for your DOS programs. If you are using QEMM's DOS-Up feature, 
  Optimize also experiments with different ways of loading parts 
  of DOS into upper memory.
                ÿþçQEMM's Optimize Program (Continued)

  When you install QEMM, INSTALL offers to run Optimize. You should 
  run Optimize again if you add new hardware devices or modify your 
  AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS files.

  Optimize must reboot your machine two or more times to complete 
  its testing. Optimize changes the lines that load device drivers 
  and TSRs by adding a LOADHI command to the beginning of those 
  lines. For example, a device driver line that looks like this:
      
                      ÿþèDEVICE=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
  
  would look something like this after Optimize has done its work:
      
                ÿþçQEMM's Optimize Program (Continued)

          ÿþèDEVICE=C:\QEMM\LOADHI.SYS /R:1 C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE

  A TSR line in AUTOEXEC.BAT that looks like this: 
      
                        ÿþèC:\DOS\SMARTDRV.EXE
  
  would look something like this after running Optimize:

              ÿþèC:\QEMM\LOADHI /R:2 C:\DOS\SMARTDRV.EXE

  For detailed information on Optimize, see Chapter 3 of the 
  QEMM manual. For information on the LOADHI command, see 
  Chapter 8.
                        ÿþçUndoing an Optimize

  When you run QEMM's Optimize program, modifications are made to
  your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files and any batch file called 
  by AUTOEXEC.BAT.

  If for some reason you want to restore these files to their pre-
  optimized states, type UNOPT at the DOS prompt. The files will be 
  restored to the state they were in before you last ran Optimize.
                        ÿþçThe Manifest Program
  
  Manifest is a powerful system reporting program that is 
  automatically installed on your hard drive when you install QEMM.  
  While Manifest can be extremely useful when troubleshooting a 
  problem, it is much more than a diagnostic tool.  Whether you are 
  new to computers or a power user with years of DOS experience 
  under your belt, Manifest will help you take full advantage of 
  the memory that is installed in your computer. Think of Manifest 
  and its companion manual as a tutorial in memory management.

  To run Manifest, just type MFT at the DOS prompt.  Open your 
  Manifest manual to Chapter Three - Road Map, then take Manifest 
  for a spin. At your own pace explore the world of memory as 
  it relates to your own PC.
         ÿþçVIDRAM - Extending Memory for Text-based Programs

  QEMM's VIDRAM program can extend conventional memory by as much
  as 96K for running DOS text-based programs. VIDRAM even extends
  conventional memory for DOS text programs running in Microsoft 
  Windows. 

  To use VIDRAM, your system must have an EGA or VGA video adapter 
  or an adapter with EGA or VGA capability (this includes VGA-
  compatible 8514A video adapters).  Your PC must have 640K of
  conventional memory and the programs that you run while using
  VIDRAM must not use EGA or VGA graphics.
   ÿþçVIDRAM - Extending Memory for Text-based Programs (Continued)

  If your PC has an EGA or VGA video adapter, the 64K memory area 
  just above conventional memory (640K-704K or A000-AFFF hex) is 
  reserved for use by graphics modes. When you run text-based 
  programs, that area is unused, so VIDRAM can appropriate it to 
  extend the contiguous conventional memory for running programs.

  It is important to understand that you cannot run EGA or VGA 
  graphics operations while VIDRAM is in use. If you routinely use 
  both large text-based programs and graphics programs, you can 
  turn the VIDRAM feature on when you need it for a text program 
  and off before you run a graphics program. If you are using an 
  8514A adapter, you can still use 8514 graphics programs while 
  VIDRAM is enabled. 
   ÿþçVIDRAM - Extending Memory for Text-based Programs (Continued)

  To turn VIDRAM on type VIDRAM ON at the DOS prompt.

  This command will extend conventional memory into the EGA/VGA
  graphics area for a total of 704K conventional memory.

  To turn VIDRAM off so you can use graphics programs again, type
  VIDRAM OFF. 

  For more information on VIDRAM, including using VIDRAM with
  Microsoft Windows, DESQview, and DESQview/X, and extending
  conventional memory an additional 32K, see Chapter 6 of the QEMM
  manual.
            ÿþçTips on Freeing Up More Conventional Memory

  If you use DOS text-based programs, you can extend conventional 
  memory by as much as 96K by using QEMM's VIDRAM feature.  For 
  information on VIDRAM, see Chapter 6 of the QEMM manual.

  The Manifest program may be able to tell you how to free up 
  a bit more conventional memory.  Run Manifest by typing MFT 
  at the DOS prompt. When Manifest displays, type H to select 
  Hints, and read the suggestions Manifest offers.

  If you do not use any programs that require DPMI (DOS Protected
  Mode Interface) memory, you can free up 1-2K, by deleting the 
  QDPMI.SYS device driver line from your CONFIG.SYS file.
                     ÿþçQEMM's New Parameter Names

  If you have upgraded from an earlier version of QEMM, be aware 
  that many of the old parameters have new names. You can still use 
  the older parameter names if you like. Below is a list of the old 
  parameter names, cross-referenced with the parameters' new names. 
  Some parameters have abbreviations which are listed in 
  parentheses.

                        ÿþçBooting without QEMM

  If you want to boot your PC without QEMM's memory management, 
  first reset your system. Use the power switch if necessary.

  When you hear a beep, hold down the Alt key until the boot 
  sequence stops. If you are using QEMM's DOS-Up feature, you will 
  see a message asking if you want to unload the DOSDATA device 
  driver; press Esc to unload it, then ÿþèimmediatelyÿþæ press and
  hold down Alt again until you see: "QEMM: Press ESC to unload 
  QEMM or any other key to continue with QEMM."

  Press the Esc key. QEMM will not load, so programs will not load 
  into High RAM, but your system will be usable.
              ÿþçContacting Quarterdeck Technical Support

  As a registered owner of QEMM, you are entitled to 90 days of
  free technical support. You can receive support by fax, mail, 
  or phone. If you have a modem, you can get support through 
  Quarterdeck's BBS, or through several other public message 
  forums. Your 90 days of free support starts with your first call, 
  letter, fax, or online communication in reference to QEMM. 
         
  Before contacting technical support, we encourage you to see
  Appendix A of the QEMM manual for troubleshooting information, 
  and Appendix B for a list of technical bulletins (technotes)
  included with QEMM. You can view technotes with QEMM Setup by 
  selecting "View QEMM hints technotes and READ.ME" at main menu.  
        ÿþçContacting Quarterdeck Technical Support (Continued)

  The troubleshooting guide and the technotes give step-by-step 
  solutions to several common problems users may experience after 
  installing QEMM. Also, be sure to see the file READ.ME in the 
  \QEMM directory for late-breaking information. You can also 
  view the READ.ME file with QEMM Setup by selecting "View QEMM 
  hints technotes and READ.ME" at the main menu.

  For information on contacting technical support see the Passport
  booklet included with QEMM or read the text file CONTACT.TEC 
  located in the \QEMM\TECHNOTE directory. To read that file, 
  view it in a text editor such as EDIT, provided with DOS 5 
  and 6, or load it into your word processor as an ASCII file.

  Quarterdeck also offers extended support, priority support and 
  corporate support plans. See the Passport booklet for information.
    ÿþçSwitching Between MS-DOS 6's Memory Manager and QEMM

  QEMM provides all the functionality of MS-DOS 6's memory manager,
  and much more. For a list of QEMM's features and how they stack 
  up against DOS 6's memory manager, see "QEMM Benefits and
  Features" in Chapter 1 of the QEMM manual.

  If you are using MS-DOS 6 and you have run its MemMaker memory
  utility, you can switch back to QEMM by running QEMM's Optimize
  program (assuming you have already installed QEMM on your hard 
  disk). To run Optimize, type OPTIMIZE at the DOS prompt. 

  If you ever want to switch back to MS-DOS's memory manager,
  simply run MemMaker again. If you are using QEMM's DOS-Up feature,
  be sure to run QSETUP and disable DOS-Up before you run MemMaker.
  ÿþçSwitching Between MS-DOS 6's Memory Manager and QEMM (Continued)
 
  If you are using QEMM's Stealth DoubleSpace feature and you
  decide to switch back to MS-DOS 6's memory manager, the 
  ST-DBL.SYS driver will perform the same function as DOS's 
  DBLSPACE.SYS /MOVE.  That is, it will allow DBLSPACE.BIN to be 
  moved into upper memory.  You can replace ST-DBL.SYS with 
  DBLSPACE.SYS, but you will suffer no ill effects if you do not.
